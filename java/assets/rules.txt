Welcome to Build&Cross!

This is a minimalistic rogue-like game, where the rules are as follows:
 > You control the player (PINK tile), and move around the map to 
 	gain resources like wood (ORANGE tiles) and iron (RED tiles)
 > You need to get those resources to build rails (WHITE tiles) on the path 
 	of the train (BLACK tile)
 > You must build enough rails to make sure that 
 	the train gets to the end of the map.
 > If the train hits a tile without a rail (GREEN tile) its game over.
 > If the train moves onto the same tile as you, it is also game over.
 
 > NOTE: keep a note of your direction. You always face the direction you last moved in.
